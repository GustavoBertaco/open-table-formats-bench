# Feature Specification: Open Table Format Dependencies Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-initial-setup-for`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Initial setup for open table format dependencies including Delta Table, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Apache Paimon, with an extensible architecture to support future formats."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: For FR-003 (version compatibility validation), what level of version compatibility checking should be implemented? → A: Validate version compatibility at plugin registration time only
- Q: What are the concurrency requirements for running benchmarks across different table formats? → A: Single table format benchmark at a time
- Q: How should the system handle plugin initialization failures? → A: Stop entire process on any plugin error
- Q: How should plugin dependencies be managed across the system? → A: Central dependency management for all plugins
- Q: What level of validation should be required for new table format plugins? → A: Full integration test for each plugin

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a data engineer, I want to set up a local development environment that supports multiple open table formats, so that I can run benchmarks across different table format implementations without having to manage dependencies separately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh project installation  
   **When** I run the project setup  
   **Then** all required dependencies for Delta Table, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Apache Paimon are available

2. **Given** the project is set up  
   **When** I check the available table formats  
   **Then** I should see all four supported formats listed and ready to use

3. **Given** the project is set up  
   **When** a new table format needs to be added  
   **Then** I can add it through the plugin system without modifying core code

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a dependency version is incompatible?
- How does the system handle missing optional dependencies?
- Plugin initialization failure must halt the entire process with clear error messages

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide centralized dependency management for all table format plugins including Delta Table, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Apache Paimon
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a plugin interface for table format integration
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate version compatibility between table format plugins at registration time
- **FR-004**: System MUST support isolated plugin dependencies to prevent conflicts
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages for dependency issues
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow adding new table formats without core code changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST run full integration tests to validate each table format plugin
- **FR-008**: System MUST include version management for each table format plugin
- **FR-009**: System MUST update documentation automatically when new formats are added
- **FR-010**: System MUST execute benchmarks for one table format at a time
- **FR-011**: System MUST halt the entire process if any plugin initialization fails

### Key Entities
- **TableFormat**: Represents a table format implementation with its dependencies and version
- **PluginInterface**: Defines the contract that all table format plugins must implement
- **DependencyManager**: Centrally manages all plugin dependencies and handles version compatibility
- **PluginRegistry**: Maintains the list of available and loaded table format plugins

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded

### Additional Notes
This feature sets up the foundation for the extensible benchmarking platform by establishing the core plugin architecture and initial table format support. Future table formats can be added through the same plugin interface without requiring changes to the core system.
