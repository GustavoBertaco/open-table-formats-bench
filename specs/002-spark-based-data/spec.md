# Feature Specification: Spark-Based Data Format Conversion and Benchmarking System

## Overview

This feature implements a Python-based Apache Spark application for reading various input file formats and converting them to different open table formats while collecting comprehensive performance metrics. The system will support automated benchmarking across different data formats, sizes, and compression methods.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What is the minimum dataset size that should be supported for performance validation? → A: Small (1MB-100MB)
- Q: What is the maximum number of concurrent format conversions to support? → A: Single conversion at a time
- Q: How long should metrics be retained locally? → A: 7 days
- Q: What is the default Spark execution mode for local deployment? → A: local[*] (all available cores)
- Q: What should happen to partially processed data if a conversion fails? → A: Delete all partial data

## Objectives

- Create a flexible Spark application for data format conversion
- Support multiple input formats (ORC, AVRO, JSON, CSV, PARQUET)
- Support writing to major open table formats
- Collect and store performance metrics for comparison
- Enable configuration-driven execution
- Provide Docker-based deployment

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully read various input formats with different characteristics
2. Convert and write data to all supported open table formats
3. Collect accurate performance metrics for analysis
4. Handle different data sizes and compression types efficiently
5. Generate comprehensive performance reports

- Configurable through YAML for custom requirements
- Memory settings adjustable per environment
- Dynamic resource allocation disabled for local mode

### Core Components

1. Spark Application
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

class TableFormatBenchmark:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        self.spark = self._create_spark_session(config)
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
        
    def benchmark_conversion(
        self,
        input_path: str,
        output_path: str,
        input_format: str,
        output_format: str,
        options: Optional[Dict] = None
    ) -> Dict:
        # Implementation for benchmarking process
```

2. Configuration Management
```python
class BenchmarkConfig:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str):
        self.config = self._load_config(config_path)
        self.validate_config()
```

3. Metrics Collection
```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics_store = {}
        
    def start_collection(self, operation: str):
        # Start collecting metrics
        
    def end_collection(self, operation: str) -> Dict:
        # End collection and return metrics
```

### Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimized image
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

# Install Java and Spark
FROM builder as runtime
COPY --from=builder /opt/spark /opt/spark
COPY . /app

# Set environment variables
ENV SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark
ENV PYTHONPATH=$SPARK_HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH

# Entry point
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/benchmark.py"]
```

### Configuration Format

```yaml
input:
  path: "/data/input"
  formats:
    - type: "parquet"
      compression: "snappy"
      pattern: "*.parquet"
    - type: "csv"
      compression: "gzip"
      pattern: "*.csv.gz"

output:

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
