# Open Table Formats Bench Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Plugin-First Architecture
The system MUST be built with extensibility as its foundation. Every component (table formats, data sources, processing engines) MUST be implemented as a plugin. Core application code MUST NOT contain format-specific, source-specific, or engine-specific logic. This ensures the system can evolve without core modifications.

Rationale: Enables seamless integration of new table formats, data sources, and processing engines as they emerge.

### II. Docker-Centric Development
All development and deployment MUST be Docker-based. The application MUST run with a single Docker command. Environment configuration MUST be containerized to ensure consistency across all deployments.

Rationale: Guarantees reproducible benchmarks and eliminates environment-specific issues.

### III. Configuration-Driven Design
All benchmark experiments MUST be defined through declarative configuration. The system MUST support a standardized configuration format for defining experiments, plugins, and runtime behavior. Configuration changes MUST NOT require code changes.

Rationale: Enables users to define complex benchmarks without understanding implementation details.

### IV. Performance Measurement Standards
All benchmarks MUST adhere to strict measurement standards. Metrics MUST include throughput, latency, and resource utilization. Results MUST be comparable across different table formats and processing engines. The system MUST account for and document variables that could impact benchmark reliability.

Rationale: Ensures benchmark results are reliable, reproducible, and meaningful for decision-making.

### V. User Experience Focus
The system MUST provide both web-based and API interfaces. All interfaces MUST be intuitive and self-documenting. Error messages MUST be clear and actionable. Documentation MUST be comprehensive and maintained alongside code.

Rationale: Makes the benchmarking tool accessible to data engineers of varying experience levels.

## Technical Standards

### Plugin Interface Standards
- Plugin interfaces MUST be stable and versioned
- Plugin dependencies MUST be isolated
- Plugin discovery MUST be automatic
- Plugin configuration MUST follow a standardized schema

### Documentation Standards
- Every feature MUST have detailed usage documentation in the 'System Documentation' folder
- All feature documentation MUST be referenced in the README's System Documentation section
- Documentation MUST include usage examples, configuration options, and error handling
- Documentation MUST be written in Markdown format
- Documentation MUST be maintained alongside code changes

### Development Workflow
- Feature branches MUST be used for development
- Pull requests MUST include plugin tests
- Pull requests MUST include feature documentation in 'System Documentation'
- Pull requests MUST update README.md to reference new documentation
- Documentation MUST be reviewed with the same rigor as code
- Docker images MUST be tested before merge

### Quality Gates
- All plugins MUST pass interface compliance tests
- Performance regression tests MUST pass
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate
- Security scans MUST pass

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
- Architecture reviews for plugin interfaces
- Performance impact assessment
- Documentation completeness check
- Security consideration review

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for plugin implementations
- Integration tests for plugin interactions
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation accuracy tests

## Governance

The Constitution serves as the highest authority for project development and operation. All development work MUST comply with these principles and standards.

### Amendment Process
1. Propose changes with clear rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing plugins
3. Community review period (minimum 1 week)
4. Implementation plan including migration strategy
5. Documentation updates
6. Version bump following semantic versioning

### Compliance
- All pull requests MUST verify constitution compliance
- Deviations MUST be documented and approved
- Regular constitution review (quarterly)
- Amendments MUST include migration guides

### Version Control
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to plugin interfaces
- MINOR: New requirements or capabilities
- PATCH: Clarifications and non-breaking refinements
